# MakeCode Arcade Mazes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/robo-technical-group/pxt-arcade-mazes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/robo-technical-group/pxt-arcade-mazes)

## Note on upgrading

If you have created a project using the version of this extension that is based on color-coded tilemaps
(the original implementation), then **do not** upgrade beyond version 2!

If you accidentally upgrade to a newer version, then roll back to an older version.

1.   **Important**: Save a copy of your project in case something goes very wrong. :-)
1.   Switch to the JavaScript Editor.
1.   Open **Explorer**. (It's beneath the simulator.)
1.   Scroll down to find this extension. (It's called `pxt-arcade-mazes`.)
1.   Delete it by selecting the trash can icon next to the extension.
1.   Import the extension again with the following URL:
     `robo-technical-group/pxt-arcade-mazes#v2.2.1`
1.   Switch back to Blocks mode (if that's what you were using).
